# La Petite Sirène Website

This is the website of a French restaurant franchise. The business serves relatively expensive food and also hosts 
events across four locations in Dublin. It's a simple responsive and trendy website that provides visitors with the current menu, 
an opportunity book tables and events and send feedback via email, as well as showing the opening times and locations on an interactive 
map.

## Design

**Color Scheme**

The site uses a a simple and minimalistic color scheme of black, white and occasionally beige and light orange to highlight 
important elements. The color scheme reflects what one might expect to find the interior of a higher end restaurant to look like. Overall,
the layout is also reminiscent of a menu. 

**Typography**

The site uses the Cedarville Cursive and Cursive fonts. Cedarville Cursive is used for the brand name and some headers. It's a very 
decorative font which makes it excellent for highlighting the most important elements and particularly the brand name, but as it can be 
laborious to read, it was used very sparingly to maintain its impact and ensure clarity of the content. Recursive is used for most of 
the content of the site instead. The fallback fonts are sans-serif and cursive, respectively.

**Imagery**

The site utilizes black and white images that both fit together well with the color scheme of the site and convey the aesthetic of the 
business. The Home page contains a space for a double-background image with the second one having a background color instead to better 
display text. The page for reservations uses a single background image. The rest of the images are the facades and interiors 
of the business on the Locations page.

## Wireframes

Preliminary wireframes were drafted in MS Paint. [Link](#)

## Features

* Responsive on all screen sizes.
* Each page includes a navigation bar.
* Each page includes a footer with links to restaurant's social media and copyright information.
*

**Features To Implement**

* A food ordering functionality with a cart that stores selected items and calculates price totals would ideally be available. 
Currently this is beyond the scope of the tools used for this site, however.
* Offering better visibility for customer reviews. This was initially considered, but in general terms most such 
businesses seem to handle customer experiences via external means such as Google. An info window for the Google Maps showing the business' 
Google reviews for a selected marker could be one option.
